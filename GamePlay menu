STORY(1)
//You are a student in our modern world living in a society with all types of people. Despite of having so many temptations and deviations in life, you have to stay focused by resisting all the unjust and immoral temptations and achieve your goals which will ultimately lead you to a happy and respectable life.//

STORY(2)
//But it's completely upto you to keep yourself safe from these social evils which are trying to attack you and preventing you from reaching a safe point of a healthy heart, mind, and body! The time is frozen and so is the entire population of your city excluding you! So, you have to fight all these evils alone and save your people from their internal demons!//

GAME FLOW(1)
//This game has a total of 6 levels. You have to start from a particular point in the city and have to reach some hidden point in your city to help save someone suffering. But keep in mind that you don't have much time left and so you have to act as quick as you can else you will lose :( //

GAME FLOW(2)
//The levels progress as you save lives. With each progressing level, you will have to act quicker, dodge more internal obstacles, and saving the suffering soul will keep getting more and more difficult! The spot to reach will be marked by a Yellow glowing circle. You will also be able to take the help of an anti-gravity zone, marked by a bright blue circle, which will raise you in the sky for three seconds during which you can try to locate the golden spot!//

GAME FLOW(3)
//Once you reach the golden spot, you will be sent to a different universe to help that person. There you will be given the situation of that person and you will replace someone close to him, so that you can help that person being someone else whom he trusts! You will have to choose one of many choices available to you, such that both that person and the one you replace are happy and saved from the trouble! Thus, choosing a proper option, you end up being a hero, saving lives//

SCORING
//The quicker you reach, the better decision you make, and the higher the level difficulty is, the more you score! If you are unable to save yourself from the internal evils, attacking you in the form of rocks falling from the sky or high speed objects trying to attack you on the road, you will lose and the game will be over :( Also making really bad decision will eliminate you :(//
