Vedant:
1) You are driving fast to the hospital since you got a call that your mom met with an accident and is unconsious now. 
   But, in this situation of haste, worry, and panic, you drive recklessly and hit someone and impact seems pretty strong.
   The time is around 2:00 AM and there is no one other than you two. You stop the car just at the impact. You are horribly scared now! 
   At this instant, you have the following options. What would you choose-
      1) Get out of the car and see if he's okay or not. And if he's unconsious, then just leave this place since anyone no one will ever know that this person died due to you!
      2) Just drive ahead since you don't know how much time does your mom have!
      3) Call an ambulance from his phone(so that you remain anonymous) and wait till it comes over there i.e. give more priority to this man than to your mom
      4) Take the man along with you, but remembrr that in your country there is death penalty for accidents due to reckless driving!
   
 2)
